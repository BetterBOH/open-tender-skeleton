# `<ConfirmButtons />`

This component is a set of two buttons-- the larger one (with a disabled option) for confirmation and the smaller one on the right for cancellation.

## Registering a custom `<ConfirmButtons />`

The `RegistryLoader` will look for a component registered at `components.registry.ConfirmButtons` and expects the key `import` to return a function that uses dynamic import syntax.
