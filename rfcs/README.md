# Requests for Comments

Requests for Comments (RFCs) will be conducted before each major addition to this repository. Creating RFCs will ensure all stakeholders have the opportunity to voice goals and concerns as this library develops. RFCs will be submitted as Pull Requests and will only be merged in once the planned feature has been agreed upon.
