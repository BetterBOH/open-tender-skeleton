# Open Tender Skeleton

This repository contains the skeletal React components for Open Tender client applications. It provides an interface that is tightly connected with [Brandibble Redux](https://github.com/BetterBOH/brandibble-redux) to enable an easy-to-configure, out-of-the-box Open Tender ordering app.

Creating RFCs will ensure all stakeholders have the opportunity to voice goals and concerns as this library develops. RFCs will be submitted as Pull Requests and will only be merged in once the planned feature has been agreed upon.
